# JSON Sorter & Beautifier (Prettier-like)

A simple **Python Tkinter application** to sort JSON keys and beautify JSON files, similar to the **Prettier** extension in VS Code. It allows users to select a JSON or TXT file, sort it recursively (A–Z), and save a prettified version to a location of their choice.

---

## Features

- Sorts JSON keys **alphabetically (A–Z)** recursively.
- Beautifies JSON with **indentation and clean spacing**, similar to Prettier.
- Handles nested JSON objects and arrays.
- **Save As dialog** prefilled with the original file name; users can rename or change location.
- Centered, user-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**.
- Supports **Unicode characters** in JSON.
- Automatically adds a newline at the end of the file (Prettier style).
